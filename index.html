                    My name is Alexander Delgado and I am a web developer. At least, I am starting to learn how to code. I am currently attending the UCF Coding Bootcamp and I cannot wait to jumpstart my career. I originally went to school for Hospitality Management, for which I almost graduated; but due to financial reasons, I was no longer able to attend classes. Since then, I have worked in the Hospitality field and I have developed solid work experience in Customer Service. It has been a great journey, but I have gotten to a point where I need to look out for my future and hone a skill I have always been interested in.

                    I first started coding back in Middle School about 16 years ago. I was a part of the Web Team, a group of students responsible for initializing and maintaining the school's website. Back then, it was mainly basic html and very small facets of CSS. When Myspace was big, I taught myself how to customize my webpage. However, I haven't worked with coding since then. This website will be used to track my progress in my development as a web developer.

                    Now for more information about me. I was born in North Hollywood, CA and moved to the Orlando area back in 1997. My mother is Colombian and my father is Mexican, so that makes me a 1st generation American. Spanish was my first language and I learned English in school. I learned French in High School, then Portuguese and Italian in college. I consider myself fluent in English and Spanish, conversationally fluent in French and Portuguese, but I am still struggling with Italian.

                    I love to play video games, especially adventure and role playing games. My favorite game series would be The Legend of     Zelda series and the Pokemon series. I also enjoy playing sandbox games, such as Rollercoaster Tycoon, and real time strategy games, such as Command and Conquer.
